We are OBSESSED w/ block patterns and we're going to build a whole bunch of 'em.  To kick things off we're starting w/ a handful of pricing table section.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How many block patterns, or website sections, do you currently offer? =

We currently offer the following professionally designed and built patterns:
-  4 pricing tables
-  4 FAQ sections

= How will these patterns look on my website? =

Results WILL vary.  We have built these patterns to leverage both your theme's styling and the pattern plugin styling.  Right now, most of the font styles including sizing and font-family will be driven by the theme you're using.  The structural styling will be driven mostly by your theme as well as the Gutenberg editor styles.  Finally, most of the cosmetic styling such as box-shadows and border-radius will be done by the pattern plugin.  We would love any and all feedback on this approach.
